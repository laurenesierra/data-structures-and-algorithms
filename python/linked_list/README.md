# Singly Linked List
This is Code Challenge: Class 5
Linked List Implementation

## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
