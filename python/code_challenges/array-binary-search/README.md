# Binary Search of Sorted Array
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
- Find length of the array and return length

- Search for value by iterating over each value in array until array value == search key parameter
 
Big O:

time:  O (n)

space: O(1)
